The project contains few simple console games.


**Guess the number**
Simple console game, allowing user to guess a number.

HOW IT WORKS?
1. System draws a random number between 1 and 100.
2. User is asked to guess the number.
3. User types the number. 
4. System checks, whether the input given by the user is a number. 
If not, it displays a message: "This is not a number' and asks again to type the number. 
If yes, it checks, whether the number given by a user is smaller or bigger than the number drawn by the system.
a). If the number given by the user is less than a random number, the system displays a message: "The number is bigger! Try again".
b). If the number given by the user is greater than the random number, the system displays a message: "The number is smaller! Try again".
c). If the number given by the user is equal to the number drawn, the system displays a message: "You're right! Congrats!" and then exit the program.
